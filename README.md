# Futbol

Starter repository for the [Turing School](https://turing.io/) Futbol project.

###
#### Check-ins throughout the duration of the project.
   - Every morning, we had a stand-up meeting before class to check in about the project, give feedbacks and update each other.
   - Slack for async work.
   - Met Friday morning to retro - very constructive, everyone felt heard and seen.

#### Plan for project organization and workflow.
   - inheritance for game, teams and game_teams class (children to StatTracker class)
   - hightest total score, highest scoring visitor and highest scoring home probably share methods (modules)
   - [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/IgorrMagalhaess/projects/1)

#### Different approaches discussed for project organization and how you collectively made a decision on which to use.
   - Driver-navigator duo
   - Asynchronous each one doing it's own test, method and refactoring one piece at a time
   - We decided for two driver-navigators. Due to time limit and amount of work, driver-navigator approach allows us to have 2 pair of eyes at all time to solve problems more easily. Having a big group and a lot of work, also seemed to be better for a first attempt as a group project to work in duos so everyone has a similar understanding for the project. This proved extremely efficient since we all have a graps of what the project is doing and how we achieved it. Everyone learning and understanding sounds like success. 

#### Approach to the code design.
   - Red, Green, Refactor: We used the RGR method. Onde we had all our methods working we focused on refactoring our code to use helper methods and after that create more classes to divide the workload. 
   - We realized early on how much one class was doing and that at some point we would need to abstract it. We were able to abstract creating a chain of child-parent classes. We thought we would need modules as well to have methods that were repeating a lot but we had timme limitations and could not abstract any further.

#### DTR document and the date it was completed. 
   - [DTR](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ysxqsB_LxHM3O6UXaH0bQ-ty_lpGmb822Qs-CYW4UgM/edit) - Completed 09/01/2024

   ##### Top 3 things that went well during your project
   - Driver and Navigator pairs - Led to less merge conflicts and when it happened it was easier to navigate.
   - Communication - every member knows what was happening at all times and have a strong understanding of the project.
   - Organization - Project is well organized and abstracted, and could be further enhanced if we had more time.
   ##### Top 3 things your team would do differently next time
   - Project Management Tool - Due to lack of knowledge on how we could efficiently use GitHub Projects.
   - Code Review after pull request - Due to lack of time, sometimes we had to merge before everyone had a chance to review and add comments to pull requests.
   - Code Abstraction - We could have created modules for the helper methods but due to lack of time we could not abstract any further.
